# Willy Wonka Ice Cream Factory


Project requirements:

-   Be creative
-   Create a page with a list of ice creams
-   If you click on an ice cream card it should open a detailed description
-   Add a filter and a sort 
-   Add a like button 

I have created an ice cream website that mainly consists of a homepage with several cards. Here, we can find the main details and by clicking on these cards, we can see the details related to the article. The code is written with React and Typescript. I have decided to opt for a colorful, yet formal design. The CSS is written with Sass and BEM to keep it organized and easier to read. As we were asked to add the like button, I used local storage to store the data, and thanks to some selects, we will have the possibility to filter and sort the results. Finally, I have added some tests made with Jest, and to check the code quality, I have used Git Action and Sonar.

Regarding the possibility of adding functionalities, we could add the option to log in and save our favorite ice creams in a private area. We could create a section to inform the client of the offers and send them emails about the latest news. We could also add more filters, a rating system for the ice creams, the option to request new flavors from the factory, and a map with nearby ice cream shops.
